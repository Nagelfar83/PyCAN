# PyCAN

This is an general purpose library for communicating over CAN (Central Area Network) written in pure python.
It currently only supports all hardware from Vector informatik GmbH. Due to a massiv rework of the libary it
is not currently working as intended. The lower level CAN Driver "can_vector_driver.py" is the only file that
is working properly. Once finnished there will be several exampels to get you on your way.

If you want to contibute to the library I would be very gratefull it would be fun to have other peoples input.

For a full documentation of the library see: https://nagelfar83.github.io/PyCAN/
